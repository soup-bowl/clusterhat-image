# Cluster HAT

Scripts and files used to build Cluster HAT images from Raspbian.

## Docker In Progress

Unfinished. Works on x86 with end-goal to run on GitHub Actions.

```bash
sudo apt install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t bob:latest .
docker run --platform linux/arm64 --rm -t bob:latest
```

## Building Cluster HAT Images

The build script is located in the build directory.

The following is normally ran as root on a fresh Raspbian images.

```
git clone https://github.com/burtyb/clusterhat-image
cd clusterhat-image/build/
# Create a config-local.sh file and copy any lines you need to override from config.sh
./create 2017-09-07
```

The "2017-09-07" date above should be the date from the Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS image you wish to convert.

When building arm64 images you need to be on an arm64 machine.
